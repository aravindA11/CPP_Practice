Exercise 4.18: What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

Answer:
Using the prefix increment operator (++pbeg) instead of the postfix operator (pbeg++) would cause two issues:
1. The first element would be skipped because the increment happens before the dereference.
2. The loop would attempt to dereference one position past the end of the vector, which is undefined behavior.
