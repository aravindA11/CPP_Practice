Exercise 4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what
conversions take place in the following expressions:
(a) if (fval)
(b) dval = fval + ival;
(c) dval + ival * cval;

Ans: (a) fval will be converted to bool
     (b) ival will be converted to float and then to double
     (c) cval will be converted to ival then they are multiplied later the result will be converted to double
