 Exercise 4.35: Given the following definitions,
 char cval;     int ival;    unsigned int ui;
 float fval;    double dval;
 identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:
 (a) cval = 'a' + 3;
 (b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
(c) dval = ui * fval;
 (d) cval = ival + fval + dval;

Ans: (a) 'a' is converted to integer then 3 is added the result is converted to char which is symbol 'd'
     (b) ival will be converted to double then ui will be converted to double after operations the result will be converted to float and stored in fval.
     (c) ui will be converted to float first then multiplied with fval the result will be converted to double
     (d) ival and fval will be converted to double and the result will be changed to char
