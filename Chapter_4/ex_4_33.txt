Exercise 4.33: Using Table 4.12 (p. 
166) explain what the following
 expression does:
 someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y

Ans: if there some value in someValue then x,y increments their value and y's previous value is returned.
    If the condition failes then x,y values decrement by 1 and y's value is returned.
