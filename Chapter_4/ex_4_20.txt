 Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a
 vector<string>::iterator, indicate which, if any, of the following
 expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and
 why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.
 (a) *iter++; // Ans: undefined behavior if vector is emtpy. else dereferes to the current element and increments iter to next 
 (b) (*iter)++; // Ans: illegal as there is no ++ operator of string
 (c) *iter.empty(); // Ans: illegal as we need to dereference first and then check if string is empty
 (d) iter->empty(); // Ans: leagal
 (e) ++*iter; Ans: 
 (f) iter++->empty();
