Exercise 3.33: What would happen if we did not initialize the scores
 array in the program on page 116?

 program:
unsigned scores[11] = {}; // 11 buckets, all value initialized to 0
unsigned grade;
while (cin >> grade) {
if (grade <= 100)
    ++scores[grade/10]; // increment the counter for the current cluster
}

Ans: if scores is not initialised then the values are default initialised and will print random values.
