Exercise 3.30: Identify the indexing errors in the following code:
 constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
 int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
      ia[ix] = ix;
Ans: the for loop is iterated from 1 through 10 where 10 is out of bound.
correct loop:
    for (size_t ix = 0; ix < array_size; ++ix)
        ia[ix] = ix;
