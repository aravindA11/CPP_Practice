 Exercise 3.12: Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in
 error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For
 those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.
 (a) vector<vector<int>> ivec; // Ans: after c++11 this is legal
 (b) vector<string> svec = ivec; // Ans: illegal vector<int> cannot be as string
 (c) vector<string> svec(10, "null"); // Ans: all 10 strings will have value null
