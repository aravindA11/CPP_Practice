Exercise 8.11: The program in this section defined its istringstream
object inside the outer while loop. What changes would you need to
make if record were defined outside that loop? Rewrite the program,
moving the definition of record outside the while, and see whether
you thought of all the changes that are needed.

Ans: 

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct PersonInfo {
  string name;
  vector<string> phones;
};

int main()
{
    string line, word;  // will hold a line and word from input, respectively
    vector<PersonInfo> people; // will hold all the records from the input
    // read the input a line at a time until cin hits end-of-file (or another error)
    istringstream record;
    while (getline(cin, line)) {
        record.clear();
        PersonInfo info;      // create an object to hold this record's data
        record.str(line); // bind record to the line we just  read
        record >> info.name;  // read the name
        while (record >> word)        // read the phone numbers
            info.phones.push_back(word);  // and store them
       people.push_back(info); // append this record to people
    }

    return 0;
}
