Exercise 9.12: Explain the differences between the constructor that
takes a container to copy and the constructor that takes two iterators.

Ans: The constructor that takes a container to copy creates a new container that is a copy of the entire container passed as an argument.
The type and size of the new container should be identical to the original container. 
On the other hand, the constructor that takes two iterators creates a new container that contains elements in the range defined by the two iterators.
This allows for more flexibility as the new container can be of a different type or size than the original container, 
depending on the range specified by the iterators.
