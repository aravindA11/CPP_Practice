Exercise 9.39: Explain what the following program fragment does:
vector<string> svec;
svec.reserve(1024);
string word;
while (cin >> word)
    svec.push_back(word);
svec.resize(svec.size()+svec.size()/2);

Ans: The program reserves 1024 string sizes and takes input from the user.
Then the vector size is additionally incremeted upto 50% with default strings.
The vector gets reallocated if the size becomes greater than 1024.
