Exercise 9.40: If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words,
what is its likely capacity after it is resized? What if it reads 512?
1,000? 1,048?

Ans: if the vector reads 256, 512 words the capacity remains same.
the capacity doesn't change after reading 1000 words. As soon as we resize after reading 1000 words the capacity is doubled to 2048.
and the same happens after reading 1024 words.
