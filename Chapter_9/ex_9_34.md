Exercise 9.34: Assuming vi is a container of ints that includes even
and odd values, predict the behavior of the following loop. After you’ve
analyzed this loop, write a program to test whether your expectations
were correct.
iter = vi.begin();
while (iter != vi.end())
if (*iter % 2)
    iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);
++iter;

Ans: the loop will be in infity. Correct way of writing

iter = vi.begin();
while (iter != vi.end()) {
    if (*iter % 2)
        iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);
    ++iter;
}
