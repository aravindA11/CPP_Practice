Exercise 9.32: In the program onpage 354 would it be legal to write the
 call to insert as follows? If not, why not?
 iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);

Ans: Arguments of a function are not assgined in specific order. Both the arguments passed are accessing same iterator so it is a undefined behaviour.
