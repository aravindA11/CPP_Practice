Exercise 2.30: For each of the following declarations indicate whether
 the object being declared has top-level or low-level const.
 const int v2 = 0; /* Ans: top-level constant */   int v1 = v2; // Ans: no const
 int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1; // Ans: no const
 const int *p2 = &v2 /* Ans: low level constant */, *const p3 = &i /* Ans: has both low-level and top-level */ , &r2 = v2;// Ans: low-level const

Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise
determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the
top-level or low-level const applies in each case.
 r1 = v2; // Ans: replaces value
 p1 = p2; // Ans: low-level const cannot be ignored
 p2 = p1; // Ans: correct but we can't use p2 to change underlying value
 p1 = p3; // Ans: error p3 has bot top-level, low-level const whereas p1 is normal pointer
 p2 = p3; // Ans: correct
