Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
 explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
 (a) std::cin >> int input_value; // Ans: cin is expectiong a value to print
 (b) int i = { 3.14 }; // Ans: value is lost so it can't be initialized with flower brackets
 (c) double salary = wage = 9999.99; // Ans: Two variables can't be defined and assigned at a same time  
 (d) int i = 3.14; // Ans: This works fine value gets truncated


 other possible way to write (c):

 int main() {
    double wage;
    double salary = wage = 9999.99;
 }

 int main() {
    double wage,salary = wage = 9999.99;
 }
