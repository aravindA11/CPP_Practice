 Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following
 variables.
 (a) int* ip, &r = ip;// ip is a pointer r is a reference to int assigining pointer to reference is error
 (b) int i, *ip = 0; // i is a integer random value and ip is a pointer to int assigned to nullptr
 (c) int* ip, ip2;// ip is a pointer and ip2 is a int variable both are unintialized so random values are present
