int i = 0, &r = i;
auto a = r;  // a is an int (r is an alias for i, which has type int)
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
 auto b = ci;  // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
 auto c = cr;  // c is an int (cr is an alias for ci whose const is top
level)
 auto d = &i;  // d is an int*(& of an int object is int*)
 auto e = &ci; // e is const int*(& of a const object is low-level const)
 auto &g = ci;       // g is a const int& that is bound to ci
Exercise 2.33: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine
 what happens in each of these assignments:
 a = 42; // Ans: assigns 42 to a  
 b = 42; // Ans: assigns 42 to b
 c = 42; // Ans: assigns 42 to c
 d = 42; // Ans: error in assigning int to int*
 e = 42; // Ans: error in assigning int to const int*
 g = 42; // Ans: error can't assign to const int&
