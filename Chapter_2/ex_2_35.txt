 Exercise 2.35: Determine the types deduced in each of the following
 definitions. Once youâ€™ve figured out the types, write a program to see
 whether you were correct.
 const int i = 42;
 auto j = i;// Ans: j is int 
 const auto &k = i; // Ans: k is reference to const int
 auto *p = &i; // Ans: p is a pointer to const int
 const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i; // j2 is constant int and k2 is reference to const int
