 Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain
 why.
 (a) int i = -1, &r = 0; // Ans: it's error to  initialise referece with literal
 (b) int *const p2 = &i2; // Ans: it's correct but p2 cannot be changed
 (c) const int i = -1, &r = 0; // Ans: correct
 (d) const int *const p3 = &i2; // Ans: correct
 (e) const int *p1 = &i2; // Ans: correct and we can't use p1 to change the value of i2 
 (f) const int &const r2;// Ans: error referece cannot be const and needs to be initialised
 (g) const int i2 = i, &r = i; // Ans: correct
