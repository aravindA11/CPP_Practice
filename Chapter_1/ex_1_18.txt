Exercise 1.18: Compile and run the program from this section giving it
 only equal values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no
 number is repeated.

Ans: If the input values are all equal, the program will count that value and print it only once with its total count at the end.
     If there are no duplicated values, each value will be printed with a count of 1.
