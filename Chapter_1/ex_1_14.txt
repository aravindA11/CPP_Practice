 Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with
 those using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using
 either form?

 Ans: Both are looping statements. The significant difference between both of them is that
for has extra stages of executions where as while has only condition.
All the control statements of the for loop can be written in it's header at one place.
Where as for a while this needs to be done explicitly within the loop and before the loop.
