Exercise 7.36: The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the
problem.
struct X {
X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
int rem, base;
};

Ans: base is initlised after rem. which makes use of base in initilising rem have undefined value.
To correct:
struct X {
X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(i % j) { }
int rem, base;
};
