Exercise 7.46: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue?
Why?
(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should
not provide a default constructor.
(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler
generates one that initializes each data member to the default value
of its associated type.

Ans: 

(a) A class must provide at least one constructor. >> A class doesn't require to define constructor.
(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list. >> A cosntructor with all default values is also default constructor
(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should
not provide a default constructor. >> true
(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler
generates one that initializes each data member to the default value
of its associated type. >> If a class doesn't defines any constructor then compiler generates one.
