Exercise 10.4: Assuming v is a vector<double>, what, if anything, is
wrong with calling accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0)?

Ans: 
The type of third argument determines the type of + operationbeing used on these objects.
So here int is used instead of double.

correct way:

accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0.0);
