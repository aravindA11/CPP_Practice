Exercise 6.15: Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_char’s
parameters In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a
plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the char
parameter c is not? What would happen if we made s a plain reference?
What if we made occurs a reference to const?

string::size_type find_char(const string &s, char c,
                           string::size_type &occurs)

Ans: the first parameter is constant because we are not changing the value and we track the count of the char in occurs so it is normal reference.
