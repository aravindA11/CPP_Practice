Exercise 6.41: Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why?
Which, if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmer’s intent?
Why?
char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
(a) init();
(b) init(24,10);
(c) init(14, '*');

Ans: All the calls are correct but (c) doesn't perform as the program intent
char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
(a) init();
(b) init(24,10);
(c) init(14, '*');
