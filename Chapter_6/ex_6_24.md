Exercise 6.24: Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are
problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.
void print(const int ia[10])
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        cout << ia[i] << endl;
}

Ans: the program is valid when the array/pointer passed is of size 10.
If this needs to be dynamic then the program can be as:
void print(const int ia[10], int siz)
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i < siz; ++i)
        cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
