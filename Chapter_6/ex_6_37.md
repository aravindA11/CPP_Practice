Exercise 6.37: Write three additional declarations for the function in the
previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing
return, and the third should use decltype. Which form do you prefer
and why?

Ans:

(i)
int ar[10];

decltype(ar) &func(params);

(ii)

using ar = int[10];

ar *func(params);

(iii)

auto func(int i) -> int(&)[10];
