 Exercise 6.39: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one
 of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.
 (a) int calc(int, int);
 int calc(const int, const int);
 (b) int get();
 double get();
 (c) int *reset(int *);
 double *reset(double *);

Ans:
(a) int calc(int, int);
 int calc(const int, const int);// invalid as there is no differentiating factor
 (b) int get();
 double get();// Overloading doesn't happen with return type this is error
 (c) int *reset(int *);
 double *reset(double *);
