/*
Exercise 5.3: Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the
while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block.
Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this
code

 #include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int sum = 0, val  = 1;
    // keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10
    while (sum +=val,++val <= 10)  
        ;
    std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is "
              << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
 }

 /*
 Ans: the rewrite diminishes the readability of the code as the use of comma operator here makes it less clear to understand the logic at first glance.
