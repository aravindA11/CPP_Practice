Exercise 5.16: The while loop is particularly good at executing while
some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until
end-of-file. The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index
steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of
each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you
could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why?

Ans: the while loop is used when the iteration is focused on condition validation whereas the for loop is used when we want all the three steps at one place.
both the loops offer same behavior. but in the case of for the iteration variable scope can be limited to the loop that way the varaible scope benefits the release of variable memory as soon as the loop exits.
